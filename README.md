# OIT Code Challenge

Started working at 3:50pm on Wednesday November 13th

My git commits will demonstrate the progress of my work.

## Notes
- Planning Notes
    - I will complete this challenge using c++ as the coding language, and I will use a terminal interface
    - After reading the instructions, I am planning to use a number of vectors to store the answer and the guesses
    - I also am planning to use a set to keep track of the letters that have been guessed and have not been guessed
    - I plan to have a main loop that perpetuates the game, and possilby a number of helper functions to assist in the intermediate steps of the game.
    - I also plan to include the words in a separate text file, as to make it easy to change the desired words without changing the code. 

I finished working at 6:26pm on Wednesday November 13th
